Positron emission tomography scanners are commonly characterized by their gamma photon sensitivity. Scanner design often requires Monte Carlo simulations to probe different geometries and materials. However, the computational load of such simula-
tions can be significant, costly and time consuming. Furthermore, the applicability of the Monte Carlo approach in optimization loops is limited as each instance, such as source position or scanner dimensions, has to be simulated independently.

This code describes an algorithm based on an analytical approach that uses characteristics of the foreseen cylindrical scanner and returns the sensitivity profile following NEMA guidelines. BGO and LYSO bulk materials and several metascintillator scenarios have been used.
